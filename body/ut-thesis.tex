%%  
%%  To comment out parts of a file, use the macro \ignore{...}
%%  around the entire block of text you want to ignore.
%%  
%%  To explicitly set the pagestyle of any inserted blank page when
%%  \cleardoublepage occurs, use one of \clearemptydoublepage or
%%  \clearplaindoublepage instead.
%%  
%%  For single-spaced quotes or quotations, use the `longquote' and
%%  `longquotation' environments.  For single-spaced, 1 1/2-spaced,
%%  or double-spaced paragraphs, use one of the environments
%%  `singlespaced', `oneandahalfspaced', or `doublespaced'.  More
%%  generally, for paragraphs with a line spacing of `n', use
%%  `\begin{newspacing}{n}...\end{newspacing}'.
%%  
%%  All other environments, commands, and options provided by the
%%  `ut-thesis' class will be described below, at the point where
%%  they should appear in the document.

%%%%%%%%%%%%         PREAMBLE         %%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Default settings format a final copy (12pt font, single-sided,
%% double-spaced, normal margins, single-spaced notes).  For a rough
%% copy (10pt font, double-sided, double-spaced, normal margins, with
%% the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use the
%% `draft' option.  The default line spacing can be changed with one
%% of the following options: `singlespaced', `oneandahalfspaced', or
%% `doublespaced'.  The notes are always single-spaced by default, but
%% can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document by
%% using the option `spacednotes'.  The size of the margins can be
%% changed with one of the following options: `narrowmargins' (1 1/4"
%% left, 3/4" others), `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%% `widemargins' (1 1/4" all), `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).  Any
%% other standard option for the `report' document class can be used
%% to override the default or draft settings.

%% ***   Add any desired options.   ***
\documentclass{ut-thesis}

%% ***   Add \usepackage declarations here.   ***


%% The line spacing of the document should be specified using one of
%% the document options given above, but if you need a line spacing
%% that is not provided by the options, you can override the default
%% line spacing for the entire document with the command
%%   `\linespacing{...}'.
%% Note that in order to get the correct appearance, the argument to
%% `\linespacing' must be equal to 1/3 + 2/3 times the desired line
%% spacing (for example, single-spaced = \linespacing{1},
%%                        1 1/2-spaced = \linespacing{1.33}, and
%%                       double-spaced = \linespacing{1.66}).

%% ***   Uncomment and fill in a value, if needed.               ***

The Random Oracle Model (ROM) is a setting where all parties, including the
adversary, have black-box access to a ``truly random function'' (the random
oracle). In this thesis, we present two results concerning security in the
ROM. First, we show that, for every canonical identification scheme, the
corresponding Fiat-Shamir signature scheme is secure in the ROM. Previously,
only ``non-trivial'' canonical identification schemes were known to yield
Fiat-Shamir signature schemes which are secure in the ROM. Second, we show how
to modify a certain discrete logarithm-based public-key encryption scheme so
that it becomes CCA2-secure in the ROM. In conclusion, we review several
``uninstantiability'' results which demonstrate that security in the ROM does
{\it not} guarantee ``real-world'' security, and briefly survey a number of
signature and public-key encryption schemes which {\it are} secure in the
``real world''.
%popularized in a cryptographic context by the work of Bellare and Rogaway.
%Proofs of security in the ROM were first introduced by Fiat and Shamir in
%1987, but didn't become widespread in the literature until the mid-nineties,
%when Bellare and Rogaway's ``random oracle methodology'' gained popularity.
%Although the precise nature of the relationship between security in the ROM
%and in the ``real world'' was unclear, such proofs were initially believed to
%provide ``strong evidence'' of security. However, in 1998 Canetti, Goldreich
%and Halevi showed that there exist signature and encryption schemes which are
%secure in the ROM yet insecure in the ``real world'', no matter what hash
%function ensemble is used to ``instantiate'' the oracle. Several other
%``uninstantiability'' results followed. We survey what is currently known
%about public-key security in the ROM and extend two previous results.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Charles Rackoff.
Working with Charlie has been an amazing experience.  This thesis is as much
his as mine, in that he both helped me decide what problems to tackle and
provided crucial insights into their solution. 

\medskip\noindent
I would also like to thank my second reader, Ian F. Blake, for his helpful
comments and suggestions.

\medskip\noindent
I am grateful to Allan Borodin and Faith Fich for introducing me to
the manifold joys of theoretical Computer Science, and to Rudi Mathon and
Christina Christara for encouraging me to pursue graduate studies.

\medskip\noindent
Last but not least, I want to thank my awesome wife Eleyna and my parents
Michael and Rimma. I wouldn't have made it through two long years of graduate
school without their constant love and support.

%%  Put your Chapters here; the easiest way to do this is to keep   %%
%%  each chapter in a separate file and `\include' all the files    %%
%%  right here.  Note that each chapter file should start with the  %%
%%  line "\chapter{ChapterName}".  Note that using `\include'       %%
%%  instead of `\input' makes each chapter start on a new page,     %%
%%  and allows you to format only parts of your thesis at a time    %%
%%  by using `\includeonly'.                                        %%
