\section{A Historical Overview}
When {\it chosen-ciphertext security} (or, equivalently, {\it
non-malleability}), now recognized as the ``right'' notion of
security for public-key cryptosytems, was first introduced in 
\cite{rackoff:chosenciphertext} and \cite{dolev:nonmalleable}, 
the ``proof-of-concept'' cryptosystems presented in both papers were hopelessly 
inefficient. A practical, efficient public key cryptosystem provably secure 
against chosen-ciphertext attack under standard hardness assumptions (in this 
case, the Decisional Deiffie-Hellman assumption) wasn't presented in 
\cite{cramer:cca2secure}. In the meantime several ad hoc, supposedly 
chosen-ciphertext secure cryptosystems (which we won't enumerate here) were 
proposed, some of them later broken.
